First of all, it does not ask you to install Node.js runtime OR npm package manager, it offers you to install them both (if you want)

Now, Node.js runtime is basically what will understand your javascript code and execute it to produce a result.

Npm package manager is a tool which will allow you to install third party libraries (other people's code) by using the command line.

npm install express

will install the framework called express for example.
